## Phone Ecommerce React App

This project is deployed on Netlfy: https://elastic-bhaskara-ace0e3.netlify.com/

This is an online cell phone store built with React.js and Bootstrap 4. To save GitHub space, the node_modules folder is not uploaded. After downloading this project, please first run create-react-app to create an original react app folder with all basic modules there, then replace the other files with this project's files. This project also installed bootstrap, router-dom and styled modules, so please make sure to run npm to install these as well.

## Usage
When you land on the home page, you will see the navbar on top and below it are all the phone products. The logo on the top left corner will take you to the home page, and the cart button on the top right corner will take you to the cart page. 

On the cart page, if your cart is empty, it will display a message saying your cart is empty. If your cart has products, it will show the products list and the total price for all products. You can also click on the trash icon to delete a product from your cart, or click "clear cart" to remove all products from your cart. There's also the PayPal checkout button that will take you to PayPal payment page to checkout.

On the homepage, you can click on a product to see its details. You can also click on the cart icon on the product image to add it to your cart. After added to the cart, the product will show "in cart" on the cart icon area. Then, a box displaying an image of the phone will show up, and below the image are two choices: continue shopping, which will close the box; or go to cart, which will take you to the cart page.
